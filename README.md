# Satisfactory Safe Launcher

1. This batch script allows you to select which version of Satisfactory you want to play (Assuming both are installed)
2. When you exit the game this will immediately backup your save to your OneDrive documents folder:
    C:\Users\%username%\OneDrive\Documents\My Games\BackUp\Satisfactory
3. OneDrive versions saved files to allow you to revert an old version should you overwrite from the Epic cloud
4. Happy pioneering
