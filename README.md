Tested only on Windows 10 using OneDrive

Zip File password is : password

SETUP: You will need to edit the first line of the file if your games are not stored in : C:\Program Files\Epic Games

1. This batch script allows you to select which version of Satisfactory you want to play (Assuming both are installed)
2. When you exit the game this will immediately backup your save to your OneDrive documents folder:
    C:\Users\\%username%\OneDrive\Documents\My Games\BackUp\Satisfactory
3. OneDrive versions saved files to allow you to revert an old version should you overwrite from the Epic cloud
4. If you want the satisfactory icon then put the file somewhere else and create a shortcut to it, this will allow you to change the icon on the shortcut via right click > properties
4. Happy pioneering
